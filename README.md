# Simple GSAP Example
## A Simple Example using GSAP to animate an Element on a page
### Notes: 
1. This example loads GSAP from a CDN.
2. The current GSAP core module is included in ./js and can be used instead of the CDN by uncommenting the appropriate line in index.html and commenting out the line in index.html that is currently loading the GSAP module via the CDN.
